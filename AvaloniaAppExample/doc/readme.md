# AvaloniaAppExample

## `Monday, 2/17/25`

- Continuing on with this sample, renaming it for `AvaloniaAppExample`
- Added `XmlStyler` from [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dabbinavo.xamlstyler)
- See [github](https://github.com/Xavalon/XamlStyler)
- Also, added `Settings.XamlStyler` to this project, because `*.axaml` files are not formatted by default by Visual Studio 2022
- Note, the file _must_ be named exactly `Settings.XamlStyler` for it to be recognized

- Also, working on [ReactiveUI](https://www.reactiveui.net/) Samples
- Also, look at [Roland's Cool Examples](https://github.com/RolandPheasant)

- A cross-platform example using Avalonia
- Note, very early days yet
- Things definitely look different in different environment
